# tic-tac-toe
A simple game of classic tic-tac-toe

Person 1: Mingyu Hu
Person 2: Devin Sharpe

This program simulates a tic-tac-toe game on a 3x3 board for two players.

The board is initiated to have string values "1" through "9". Then the game
takes 9 turns for the players to fill out the board. One player fills "X" and
the other player fills "O". The board is updated and displayed after each turn.
Once 9 turns are completed, the game ends.

To run the code to play, run the following:
$ make clean; make; ./tictactoe
